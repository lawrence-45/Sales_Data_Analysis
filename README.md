# Sales_Data_Analysis
While delving into a sales dataset, I employed SQL to tackle essential business queries and extract valuable insights from the data. This process not only answered key questions about our sales performance but also provided a deeper understanding of the dataset's patterns and trends. Consequently, this hands-on experience played a pivotal role in strengthening and refining my SQL skills, contributing to a more comprehensive grasp of data analysis in a business context.
